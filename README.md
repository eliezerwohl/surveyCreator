# surveyCreator

For my first post graduation project, I'm trying to make a site where a user can create
surveys, similiar to Google Forms.

#Front End
Angular, Bootstrap

#Back End
MEAN Stack

each survey has
question array

each question
has type
options (for radio and checkbox)


the page will render and append eachone, having the data-type of each being the id of each question
