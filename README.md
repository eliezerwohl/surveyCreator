# surveyCreator

For my first post graduation project, I'm trying to make a site where a user can create
surveys, similiar to Google Forms.  There are currently 4 different choices of inputs.  Stretch goals include automatic and manual pagination, custom form validation, and progress bar.

#Front End
Angular, Bootstrap, as much vanilla Javascript as possible.

#Back End
Express, Angular, Node.
